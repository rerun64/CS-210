1)Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.; for tthis project I made a banking application for users to view balances and make deposits. I designed the code based on the requirements from the client.

2)What did you do particularly well? I was impressed with how little I needed to adjust my math. 

3)Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I need to work on using functions and spreading my code out. I still find myself coding a ton and then I am stuck debugging a big mess instead of finishing the project.
  
  4)Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? My problem has always been the layouts of the menus. My *** always end up uneven and the layout isnt pleasing to the eye.
  
5)_What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? Everything about this project was memorable and fun. I am sure I will be using the skills i learned here in the future. 

6)How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? I paid close attention to my comments. I tried to use them as much as possible. Working on those industry standards
